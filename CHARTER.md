A good Task Group (TG) charter describes how it achieves filling in a gap defined by the Special Interest Group (SIG) or Committee that spawned it (directly or dotted line). It lists the specific small set of  deliverables it will deliver.

A SIG is an extension of a Committee, in that its only deliverables are strategy, gaps, and prioritizations, and helping spawn other SIGs or TGs to fill the gaps. A good SIG charter spells out the small set of topic areas their strategy will address along with its responsibilities as laid out in this bullet.
